            <main><h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my About Me page. My name is Tristin and I'm 33 years old. I currently live in Redmond, WA working as a software integration engineer for a company which develops a real-time SaaS environment to manage automated dispensing solutions. I've attended the Art Institute of Seattle and have worked as a freelance graphic designer for many years.</p>
                <p>I joined the US Navy right out of high school in 2005. I spent 10 years in as a submariner on the USS Ohio. Aboard, I was a Systems Administrator working on the multiple computer networks. With the Navy, I moved around from all over the East Coast to here in Washington. While on deployment, I've visited Guam, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Singapore. I really enjoyed my time enlisted and I'm grateful for the opportunities it's given me.</p>
                <p>Originally from Southern California, I've now lived in Washington since '07. It's quite a different atmosphere, but I love it up here. California will always hold a place in my heart, but Washington is now home. I just recently moved to Redmond where I'm able to bike to work every day.</p>
                <p>Growing up I was always an animal fan. I've had hampsters, dogs, cats, and even horses. The last few years I lived in California, my family owned a small ranch that raised Peruvian Pasos. Currently, I have a 5 year old rescue cat name My Kitty Love. While weary of new people, she's a huge snuggler once she get's to know you. She's never far when I'm at the computer coding.</p>
                <p>While I have quite a large extended family all over the US, I'm an only child. I'm thankful for the time my dad was able to spend with me growing up and the plentiful amount of friends I had, as I never had an issues not having any brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>I am currently engaged to my girlfriend of 6 years Anna. She's absolutely wonderful and I'm ecstatic to have her with me in life. She is my main motivation in life and she supports me through all of my projects and goals. I'm excited to complete the Code Fellows Javascript courses to move into the next chapter of my life. I'm hoping to transition into a front-end developer role where I can build great looking, functional web apps.</p>
